# Improbable Beef

## Purpose:
#### Rosa, a prominent researcher that works in a microbiological laboratory, has teamed up with Improbable Beef to identify a bacterial specie that would make it possible to synthesize proteins that taste like beef. She strongly believes that the naval would contain such bacterial species. In order to test her hypothesis, she has sampled the navels of several people across the country. Now, in order to make this data more accessible, she wants us to create an interactive webpage. Furthermore, this will allow volunteers to check whether their belly button contains one of the top 10 bacterial species for synthetic beef.
